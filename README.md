## Considerations

This project uses Eslint to maintain the code clean and organized between developers, specifically StandardJs configuration and rules  

This means that in order to Eslint to work properly you will need to install Eslint vsCode extension. 

You can find the extension - [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) -

More info about [EsLint](https://eslint.org/)

More info about [StandardJs](https://standardjs.com/)

## VSCode extensions

Some extensions of Vs Code can be used to improve development and keep the code
the same between developers.

- [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) (This extension replaces the use of PostMan or other REST services, use which ever you preffer)
