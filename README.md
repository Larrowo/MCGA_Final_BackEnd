Considerations

This project uses Eslint to maintain the code clean and organized between developers, specifically StandardJs configuration and rules

This means that in order to Eslint to work properly you will need to install Eslint vsCode extension.

You can find the extension - here -

VSCode extensions

Some extensions of Vs Code can be used to improve development and keep the code the same between developers.
